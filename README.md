# IONDV. CRM
## Description

IONDV. CRM is a software solution based on the IONDV. Framework, implemented for the organization of registration, accounting, storage and display of business data (incoming requests, calls, visitors, products, services). The system allows you to organize scenarios for answering calls, keep records of emails and calls, conduct sales of products and activities based on them, keep track of marketing events, maintain a data base of individual and company clients, compile directories, make reports, etc.

The demo version shows an example of using the system to provide technical support – it allows you to register incoming requests from users in various forms (letters, calls, meetings, e-mail). In this case, the demo version shows an example of using the system for a store that is selling recreation goods and tourist equipment. The system allows to register incoming requests (calls) and at the same time to show prompts/scripts to the operator registering the request or call on the specified request topic.
